Yu-Gi-Oh! Draft Deck picker by AntoMelon

Currently contains 359 cards. So you if you're going for high number of picks (50-60),
you should currently limit yourself to 5 players.

How to use the draft picker ?
1. Execute draft-picker.jar
2. Fill in the number of players, their names, and the number of picks
3. A button should appear at the bottom. If you can't see it, resize your window to make it appear
4. Click the "Picks cards" button to show the cards for the pick
5. A player will be chosen at random to pick a card. To pick a card, click the button with the card name
on it. It will always be on the right of the card. If you are more than 3 players, you will have to use the
scrollbar at the bottom to show all the cards.
6. Once all picks are done, the "Pick Button" will become locked. Decks will then be written in the
format the EDOPro recognizes
7. Retrieve your decks from the "decks" folder and use something like Discord to send their decks to 
every player.
8. Copy-paste your deck in your EDOPro deck folder
9. You're all set and ready to play !

Tips:
- Don't rename the folders or the images, it won't work anymore if you do so.
- You sadly can't add cards by yourself, you'll have to play with the ones I put inside (adding images won't
do anything)
- To find your EDOPro deck folder, look for Project Ignis\deck. If you didn't choose a specific location
when you installed it, it should be in your disk's root.
